    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Ho ho ho! Here we are—December 31st, the last day of the year! What a magical holiday season it’s been. 🎄 I’ve had so much fun sharing updates, chatting with you, and bringing Christmas joy to homes around the world. But as the clock strikes midnight tonight, the website will go into its off-season mode.</p>

        <p>We’ve had a year filled with magic, fun, and heartwarming moments, and I can’t wait to see what the new year holds. The elves and I are already getting ready for next Christmas, and we’ve got some exciting things planned that will make your holiday season even more special. 🎄🎉</p>

        <p>That means most of the pages will close for updates, so don’t miss your last chance to explore <a href="village.html">Santa's Village</a>, <a href="route.html">Santa's Route</a>, and more! The chatroom will also close until next December, so if you’ve got any last questions or just want to say hi, stop by <a href="chat.html">Chat with Santa</a> today.</p>

        <p>The NPN will stay open all year long, with occasional updates from the North Pole to keep the Christmas spirit alive. Until next December, keep spreading kindness and holiday cheer—you’re what makes this season so magical. 🎅💖</p>

        <p>Happy New Year's Eve (or Happy New Year for some of you), my friends, and see you in 2025! 🎉✨</p>

        <p>Ho ho ho! December 30th is here, and the elves are already hard at work preparing for next year. You’d think they’d take a break after Christmas, but no! They’re brainstorming new ideas, testing out fun activities, and even giving the workshop a fresh coat of paint. 🖌️✨</p>

        <p>They're also planning exciting new features for the site, including new Christmas activities, fun surprises, and maybe even a few changes to how the site works! 🎄🛠️</p>

        <p>With all the planning underway, I wanted to give you a quick reminder—most of the website’s pages will close on January 1st as we get ready for an even more magical December next year. This includes <a href="sleigh.html">Santa's Sleigh</a>, <a href="route.html">Santa's Route</a>, and even <a href="chat.html">Chat with Santa</a>. So, if you haven’t yet had a chat or explored the pages, now’s your chance!</p>

        <p>I’m really looking forward to seeing what these creative little minds come up with in 2025. So, if you haven’t already, be sure to explore <a href="workshop.html">Santa's Workshop</a> to see how the elves are bringing holiday joy to life!</p>

        <p>Don’t worry, though—the NPN will stay open all year, and I’ll be popping in now and then with updates. Until then, make the most of these last festive moments! 🎅🎄</p>
